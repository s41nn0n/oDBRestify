# About
A package to restify a oracle DB

I have not worked on securing the rest services. At the moment this is not ready to be exposed externally at all.

I build this for an minimal user internal facing application to read data from a database.

# TODO
. SECURITY
. GET
. PUT
. DELETE
. UPDATE
. OpenAPI
. Cache
. Code Standard


# Security
. Auth
. Database Restrictions
. Request Limitations

I was thinking that we could leave some of the auth to other applications.
